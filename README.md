# Number_Guessing_Game_Project01

Hello! 

  My name is Carlos A. Marin, and this is my first project from the Team Treehouse Tech-Degree program.
  This program generates a random integer between (1 - 10). The program will continue to prompt for a guess, until the guess is a matched with the randomly generated number. Once a match is found the player will be scored based on the number of attempts to guess the correct number. The player with the least amount of guesses is crowned the winner!
  
REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  Basic Requirements:
  
    1) Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
    2) As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the      menu.
    3) As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
    4) As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
    5) As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.
    
  Extra Credit:
  
    1) As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.
    2) As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
    3) As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points), so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
  
  Enjoy!
