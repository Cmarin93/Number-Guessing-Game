Hello! 

  My name is Carlos A. Marin, and this is my first Python Project!
  
  ![Alt text](Main_Frame.jpg?raw=true "SS of first view.")

  How the Program Works:
  This program generates a random integer between (1 - 10). 
  The program will continue to prompt for a guess, until a guess is matched with the randomly generated number. 
  Once a match is found the player will be scored based on the number of attempts to guess the correct number. 
  The player with the least amount of guesses is crowned the winner!
